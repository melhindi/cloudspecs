## Paper

Cloudspecs was accepted at the [CIDR 2026](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2026/program.html) conference.
You can find a preprint of our paper [here](https://vldb.org/cidrdb/papers/2026/p17-steinert.pdf).

```
You can access your local deployment at [`http://localhost:5173/`](http://localhost:5173/)

## Custom Reproducibility Sites
You can use the Cloudspecs framework to create custom reproducibility sites for your own papers by forking this repository and replacing Cloudspecs with your own database.
You'll probably want to replace/adapt the following files:
- static/cloudspecs.duckdb
- static/sample-queries.json
- components/db.js
- vite.config.js

Cloudspecs does not require a web server and can be hosted e.g., on GitHub Pages.
We also provide a LaTex package (in the `latex` folder) that showcases creating clickable figures that reference your reproducibility site from within your paper.
